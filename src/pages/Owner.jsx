        That was the last picture of my work. Back then, I never thought that
        one day I would have to take on many different roles. Even though it
        wasn't the job I loved, it provided the most stability in life. Life is
        like an airplaneâ€”there are ups and downs, turbulence along the way. Now,
        five years have passed. I've done things I never imagined, traveled to
        many places, but nothing has ever been as clear as it is today. From
        this moment on, there's no turning back. I must transform myself into a
        programmer and fulfill the dream I've had for decades.
